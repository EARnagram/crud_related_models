# CRUDing Related Models â€” Self References, n:n

## Self References: a User habtm Users as friends

Many CRUD apps need users to friend each other, making mutual connections
between one another.  Unlike the previous Follow `1:n` relationship, the
Friendship model will be a **symmetrical**/**bi-directional** self-referencing
association.

A good way to think of this is that, when "friending", _we create and destroy
mutual relationships._ Unlike the `1:n`, we do not differentiate between
two kinds of relationship. Both influencing each other in the same way,
containing multiple friendships.

### Understanding and Context

Unlike following, friendship is symmetrical, therefore creating a
has_many_and_belongs_to relationship within one model. You may think we can
simply use a habtm relationship to itself:

![wrong ERD][erd-self-ref-idea-nn]

But, of course, that makes a nightmare of methods and terribly inefficient
database queries.

As with the previous self-referencing relationship, we'll of course use a join
table.

![correct ERD][erd-self-ref-nn]

Notice that unlike the `1:n`, we'll need two attachments to the same model.
Due to the symmetrical nature of friendships we will need a more complex join
table than the previous 1:n.

We must specify the name of the join table, as well as the joining
columns just like the `1:n` self-referential relationship. In addition, we'll
need to create a flip-flop of the index, as we may need to locate friend's
friends in our site as well.

### Migrations

In order to make our migration, let's go ahead and create the model first -
we'll add to it later.

`$ rails g model Friendship user_id:integer friend_id:integer`

This migration will only store two user_ids, however, it will store them in both
directions. This gives us the ability to find friends and friends of friends.
Additionally, the symmetrical indices will greatly speed up our database
queries.

Let's change the migration file and add in those indices!

```ruby
class CreateFriendships < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :friendships do |t|
      t.integer :user_id
      t.integer :friend_id

      t.timestamps null: false
    end

    add_index :friendships, [:user_id, :friend_id], unique: true
    add_index :friendships, [:friend_id, :user_id], unique: true
  end
end
```

Now that we have a way of finding our Friendships within our database we're
ready to migrate. Nothing needs to be added to our User's migration file.

`$ rake db:migrate`

Now, lets handle the relationships between our User model and Friendship model.

### Models

The additional index for database queries actually makes our models much more
simple. While we know we must implement a `n:n` relationship, we also know we
must use our Friendship model as a join table.

Let's first look at what our User model must add to implement the `:through`
association.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base

  #...
  has_many :friendships
  has_many :friends, through: :friendships
  #...
end
```

We now have initialized the first of two ways to view the friendship - but what
about from the other direction? Here's where that extra index comes in handy:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base

  #...
  has_many :friendships
  has_many :friends,             through: :friendships
  has_many :inverse_friendships, class_name: "Friendship",
                                 foreign_key: "friend_id"
  has_many :inverse_friends,     through: :inverse_friendships,
                                 source: :user
  #...
end
```

Now we can see we can make media queries using either user_id.

We now need to create the corresponding associations in the Friendship model:

```ruby
class Friendship < ActiveRecord::Base

  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :friend, :class_name => "User"
end
```

In the Friendship model, we only need to attach either side of the friendship
association. We're now ready to move onto routes!

### Routes

Luckily, most of the hard work is behind us - for the routes, we only need to
make a `#create` and `#destroy` route for our friendships.

Here's what we're looking for:

| HTTP Request |    URL    |   Action  |      Named Route      |
|:------------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------------------:|
| POST         | users/:id | create    | friendships_path(:id) |
| DESTROY      | users/:id | destroy   | friendship_path(:id)  |

Luckily, this is nothing but a limited `resources` in our routes:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do

  #...
  resources :friendships, only: [:create, :destroy]
  #...
end
```

We only need a create and destroy method for the join table, so those are all
we need inside our FriendshipsController.

```ruby
class FriendshipsController < ApplicationController

  def create
    @friendship = current_user.friendships.build(:friend_id => params[:friend_id])
    if @friendship.save
      flash[:notice] = "Added friend."
      redirect_to root_url
    else
      flash[:error] = "Unable to add friend."
      redirect_to root_url
    end
  end

  def destroy
    @friendship = current_user.friendships.find(params[:id])
    @friendship.destroy
    flash[:notice] = "Removed friendship."
    redirect_to current_user
  end
end
```

As we can see, we're building and destroy our relationships within our database
by finding them through the parameters :id field.

From here, you can build ways to confirm friendships, add logic to your views,
and improve the flash messages. However, the `n:n` self-referencing assocation
is now complete - feel free to use these routes in the way you see fit!
