While we went in to CRUDing in depth with a single model, and we explored
what it means to link, or **relate**, our models, we haven't shown you an
example of some of the tools Rails gives us to CRUD related models.

To that end, we have four examples/walkthroughs to show you about
how to structure the models, views, controllers and routes when trying
to CRUD resources whose structure depends upon their relations:

1.  <%= "[" unless @options[:one_n] %>**1:n (one-to-many) relationships**: *a `Shelf` has many `Book`s*.<%= "][crud-1n]" unless @options[:one_n] %>
2.  <%= "[" unless @options[:n_n] %>**n:n (many-to-many) relationships**: *a `Topic` has and belongs to*
    *many `Book`s*.<%= "][crud-nn]" unless @options[:n_n] %>
3.  <%= "[" unless @options[:mul] %>**multiple named relationships**: *a `User` has many `Book`s they've created,*
    *and habtm `Book`s they've "favorited."*<%= "][crud-mu]" unless @options[:mul] %>
4.  **self referential relationships**:
    - <%= "[" unless @options[:s_one] %>***(1:n)*** *a `User` has many `User`s as* ***followers***<%= "][crud-s1]" unless @options[:s_one] %>, and
    - <%= "[" unless @options[:s_n] %>***(n:n)*** *a `User` has and belongs to many `User`s as* ***friends***<%= "][crud-sn]" unless @options[:s_n] %>.
